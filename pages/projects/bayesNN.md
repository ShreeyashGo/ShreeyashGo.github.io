<b><emp><u>Abstract</u></emp></b>: Bayesian ML is a branch of ML relating to creating statistical models based on the Bayes Theorem. Through this project, I learnt about Bayesian ML and Metropolis-Hastings Sampling Algorithm. I created a 2 layered Bayesian NN with warm starting modeled around a 2 layered MLP for the XOR problem. I was able to get a best accuracy of 84.4% on the testing data when I trained on 10,000 data points for 2000 iterations. This was better than the base accuracy of 55%  obtained through random choice of the weights.
