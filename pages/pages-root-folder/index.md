<h3> Hello! </h3> 
<p style="font-family:georgia,garamond,serif; margin:2px 0px 0px 0px">
Welcome to my website! I am Shreeyash Gowaikar. I am a pre-final year student at the Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani, Goa Campus. I am pursuing a major in Computer Science with a minor in Data Science.
<p style="font-family:georgia,garamond,serif;">
My research interest lies in Computer Vision and Generative Adversarial Networks and I would really like to learn Reinforcement Learning. I have had experience with multiple GAN architectures and find GANs really intriguing. I am currently working with Prof. Tanmay Verlekar on a Study oriented Project with APPCAIR, BITS Pilani Goa Campus. I am working on Image to Video Transfer Learning for Transformer-based models.
I am actively looking for Academic and Corporate Research Internships which could create a positive impact in the research communinty!
