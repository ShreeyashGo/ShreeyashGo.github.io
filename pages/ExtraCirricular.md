## Description {#desc}

My undergraduate university, BITS Pilani Goa Campus, has offered me ample opportunities to grow in spheres of life not pertaining to only academics.

I am an active part of the coordinating team of a Student Chapter of a National Level NGO. I am a part of a college society of students who love the universe and do sky-gazing often. I am part of the Department of Photography of my university, a society reponsible in covering each and every major event on campus from college festivals to the convocation ceremony. 

All these have helped me learn exciting stuff tremendously and the following a brief summary of the same.

## College Societies {#socs}

### Nirmaan Goa Chapter {#nirmG}

I am the <emp>Treasurer</emp> and the <emp> Publicity & Design Head</emp> of the Nirmaan Goa Chapter. We are a student chapter of a National NGO and work in the fields of education, healthcare and empowerment of the people from the nearby urban slums.

Being the Treasurer, I along with the president of the chapter handle the finances of the entire chapter. This has helped me implement the knowledge of accounting I had learnt in my college curriculum. Being the Publicity and Design Head has helped me gain leadership skills and apply my creativity for a platform that makes an impact in the society. I lead a team of 10 juniors, who carry out the publicity and design aspect of the entire chapter!

### Department of Photography {#dopy}

I am also an active part of Department of Photography (DoPY BITS Pilani Goa Campus). I was inducted in my first year and since then I have learned a lot and have creatively inculcated my passion for Photography and Videography. I learned how to operate a DSLR and the nitty-gritties of Photography. I also learned how to edit photos and videos and have also developed a recent passion for the same!

### SEDS Celestia {#sedsC}

I am an active part of SEDS Celestia, the Astrophysics and Astronomy Club of my college. We are a group of space enthusiasts who have long discussions about the universe and STEM in general! Being a part of this club has helped me socialize with my peers and has incuclated my hobby of Stargazing.
